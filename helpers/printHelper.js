//code explained:
//The add function takes two parameters, a and b, and returns their sum.
//The subtract function takes two parameters, a and b, and returns the result of subtracting b from a.
//Both functions are exported, making them available for import in other files.
//The Person class is defined with a constructor that initializes the name and age properties.
//The greet method logs a greeting message to the console, using the instanceâ€™s name and age.
//This class is exported as the default export, meaning it can be imported without curly braces
